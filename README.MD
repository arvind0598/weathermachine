# The Weather Machine

  

Uses the GeoLocation and OpenWeatherMap API to show the current weather.

  

## Stack

  

The project is built with React 16.11.10 and TypeScript, and so also uses the Context API.

Dependencies are bundled using the Parcel Bundler.

Currently uses the Bulma CSS CDN, might switch to the package later.

  

## Installation

  

First, get yourself a (free) API key from (OpenWeatherMap)[https://openweathermap.org/api].

Clone this repository by doing ```git clone git@github.com:arvind0598/weathermachine.git```.

In the project directory, create a .env file that looks like this and put in your own API key.

  

```yaml

API_KEY=xxx

```



Now use any of the NPM scripts after installing dependencies.
